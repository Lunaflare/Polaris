.maybe a role table per hotel (would add column for role table also to hotel ref)
.in db store number of things in read that are not roles (i.e. everything that comes before the roles)
	-right now I am using a static number for this
.might want table saying which hotelID corresponds to which hotel (mostly for our records)
.store "accounting" for particular months/weeks/years in order to calculate extra stuff in top left of grid?
	-right now these calculations will not be correct because there is a hardcoded number for "accounting"
.should store the names of roles that are necessary for special calculations in read
	-then can actually edit the names of these roles
