.change password web stuff should make sure the email address you give is linked to the user's account and not just in the db - this is already being done
.make sure login form buttons go to correct links - ONLY "Register" needs changing
.add 2014 excel data to input and read tables
.Add button to remove a date?
.Make way for user to upload new labor standards
.easy input of budget dollars & productivity (explanation needed)
.allow user in input once they have selected a date if press back should let them select a new date
.in db store number of things in read that are not roles (i.e. everything that comes before the roles)
	-right now I am using a static number for this
.round to exact same number of decimal points in read as in excel?
	-also format numbers the same way (i.e. dollar sign etc)
.changed in role table managers role wages from 21.47 to 23.55 to match how is in 2013 newer labor stds
.changed hotel_ref avg pay per hour from 14.23 to 15.86 and overtime per hour from 21.34 to 23.79
.temporarily for testing changed in role table pm housemen's lookup to be carpet care instead of pm rooms cleaned
	-so that all data would line up for testing (december 2013 namely)
.store "accounting" for particular months/weeks/years in order to calculate extra stuff in top left of grid?
	-right now these calculations will not be correct because there is a hardcoded number for "accounting"
.all buttons "stay clicked" when they have been clicked and then you return to the form where they were clicked
	-may or may not be something to adjust for
.fix read floating point error and instead show error message for user saying that there isn't any data for the query
	-there is a place for cody to put in error messages (4 locations, 3 in first populateGrid, 1 in second populateGrid)
.set up updater to send out most recent version in github -(in progress)
.when add or edit role need to recalculate avg wages and such in hotel_ref
.add ability to view labor standards from read
.add ability to print grid from read
.need to check against duplicate role names in edit and add role
	-need to not allow the change of the three specific names of roles associated with extra calculations
	-need to make list of all role names that shouldn't be name changed b/c of input/read forms
.could add ability to view literally all the data by day in read or somewhere else
