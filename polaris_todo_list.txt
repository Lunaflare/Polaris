.make sure login form buttons go to correct links - ONLY "Register" needs changing
.taskbar issue for all forms (does not show up as minimized in taskbar)
.add timer icon code between transitions with expected delays (excess database interaction, etc.)
.add old input data to raw_input table
.enforce password constraints when changing the password
.sanitize login input
.for input forms both basic and advanced - type check/error check (i.e. blank cells)
.write message saying use arrow keys in grids (for users knowledge)
.change first day of week in calendars to saturday (to match dlr)
	-will this throw off week calculations?
.Add button to remove a date?
.Make way for user to change/upload new labor standards
	-this should change any values in tables from old labor standards
.when change in basic input & press back, it doesn't save

.make year selection in read dynamic (i.e. only pull years that are in read_data)
.need to not allow next button to be clicked in read unless a filter has been selected
.easy input of budget dollars & productivity (explanation needed)

	-may or may not want to implement this
.allow user in input once they have selected a date if press back should let them select a new date
.Asyncronous submission of data
.might want to adjust db field types based on how we want to display (i.e. round before, sometimes want whole number)
.allow user to add roles
.in db store number of things in read that are not roles (i.e. everything that comes before the roles)
	-right now I am using a static number for this
	-in db create table holding things we have in read table that are not roles
.round to exact same number of decimal points in read as in excel?
.in month of read also need to pick a year
	*or do we assume month and week are always the current year?
.sometimes in read get error (floating point)

.make occupancy percent calculations more effecient (less db queries)
