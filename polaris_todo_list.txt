.add old input data to raw_input table
.change first day of week in calendars to saturday (to match dlr)
.Add button to remove a date?
.Make way for user to change/upload new labor standards
	-this should change any values in tables from old labor standards

	-may or may not want to implement this
.make year selection in read dynamic (i.e. only pull years that are in read_data)
.need to not allow next button to be clicked in read unless a filter has been selected
.easy input of budget dollars & productivity (explanation needed)

	-may or may not want to implement this
.allow user in input once they have selected a date if press back should let them select a new date
.in db store number of things in read that are not roles (i.e. everything that comes before the roles)

.in settings form - "add role" and "edit dlr" button stay "clicked" when look at them again after going to add role form and pressing back or home

.labor standards in database do not match up to the excel sheets
